** WARNING: backwards incompatible release **
- PanZoomComponent: removed support for the components child-related overrides, the component now requires that you pass in an instance of a PanZoomComponent as the component's only child, but it isn't all bad news, because content can be manipulated, replaced, etc. at runtime; additionally, it's clearer to the developer the construction of the component and its content

- PanZoomComponent: added support for initially loading centered on a particular point
- PanZoomComponent: added support for fixing the zoom point for all zooming operations

- PanZoomComponent: added support for accessing the custom scroll bars, and a property that can be used for showing/hiding the scrollbars
- PanZoomComponent: fixed problem with setting the scale value manually
- PanZoomComponent: added validation not yet present for things like ensuring that content dimensions are set, etc.
